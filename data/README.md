# Major League Soccer (MLS) Stats Analysis
This project was inspired by the inaugural 2023 season of St. Louis City SC. I have always been a fan of "the beautiful game", but I wanted to explore these questions:
- Which stats have the greatest impact on results? (*e.g.: How do they correlate with goals/goals against?*)
- What makes certain stats more descriptive than others? (*e.g.: Why is forward passing accuracy is more useful than general passing accuracy?*)
- How can I use data visualization to get a better overall profile of various MLS teams?

### Data
Following the [MLS Stats Site](https://www.mlssoccer.com/stats/), I requested club and player data from the MLS Stats API. Then, I cleaned and selected the data using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

### Visualizations
I produced custom data visualizations using [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
